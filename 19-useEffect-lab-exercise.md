# useEffect Lab Exercise

1. The component fetches the `contacts.json` file and renders it, but it does not yet handle errors. Write error handling code to display a message in the component if an error occurs. Simulate an error by renaming or moving the `contacts.json` file.

2. On a slow network, the `contacts.json` may take time to load. Simulate this in the DevTools by switching "Network Throttling" to a slower speed.

   Write code in the component to display "Loading..." when the contacts are being fetched.
